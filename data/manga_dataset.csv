From an early age  he used his dexterity to contribute to his peers in a variety of crafts. Leopin and his friends entered the Royal Pioneer Academy. However  during the ""Ritual of Ability Development"" at the entrance ceremony  the status given to Leopin was disastrous.  ""Occupation: Unemployed."" ""All statuses except dexterity remain at their initial values and do not grow."" ""Skill is dexterous  master of none.""  Leopin's classmates exiled him because he had nothing to offer other than his dexterity. Leopin is placed in the ""Special Training Class""  a class for failures. Leopin is left all alone. However  he realizes that the skill he has been given  ""Poor Dexterity "" has an unexpected performance. That is...  You can convert your dexterity status to any other status. You can change your occupation to any one you want.  The first thing Leopin did was to become a lumberjack. First  Leopin changed his job to ""Lumberjack"" to get wood from the forest. He then became a carpenter and built the most magnificent house of all. He became an Appraiser to identify rare items  and a Battle Axe User to fight off students from other classes who tried to attack him. Become a Ranger to explore dungeons and a Ninja to get through traps with ease. Leopin  alone (solo)  had gained enough power to do everything.  As Leopin continues to be a warrior  he is adored by his childhood friend  a saint  and admired by a beautiful alchemist  and his activities become even more well known. On the other hand  the classmates who expelled Leopin regret their decision to do so when they witness Leopin's abilities. Their home remains a shack  they are unable to explore  and they gradually lose their place in the school and are ruined. ___ **Explanation:** the skill is not ""poor dexterity""  but ""dexterous poor""  which is the Japanese equivalent to a Jack of all trades  master of none; since they can do a bit of everything  they are ""dexterous""  but since they have mastered none  they supposedly cannot make a living from it  hence they are ""poor"". Another manner of saying you have high dexterity is to be ""handy""  back-translated from DEX as in *manual* dexterity from early RPGs. ""An unemployed handyman who does a bit of everything"" just doesn't quite roll off the tongue."

Manga-style adaptation of the popular fan fiction by E.Yudkowsky: ""Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality"". Read left to right.

The best term I've heard for this fic is ""parallel universe"".  The text contains many clues: obvious clues  not-so-obvious clues  truly obscure hints which I was shocked to see some readers successfully decode  and massive evidence left out in plain sight. This is a rationalist story; its mysteries are solvable  and meant to be solved.  All science mentioned is real science. But please keep in mind that  beyond the realm of science  the views of the characters may not be those of the author. Not everything the protagonist does is a lesson in wisdom  and advice offered by darker characters may be untrustworthy or dangerously double-edged."
